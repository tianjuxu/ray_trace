A simple but effective renderer using basic ray-tracing technique. This is being continuously developed on Windows. To compile this, simply downlad a g++ compiler and run make file. Running the program will output an image of .bmp format in the folder. Currently implements reflections and basic shadowing. Next commit will include basic anti-aliasing or hopefully other advanced rendering techniques.
